            <h2>Basics of Dribbling</h2>
                <p>
                    Dribbling is one of the most improtant aspects of basektball.
                    Learning how to dribble will help you get around the court confidently.
                    When the ball is first in your hands you are in a position that is commonly known as 
                    the "Triple Threat."
                    This means that you have three options to do with the ball.
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <li>
                                Dribble
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Pass
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Shoot
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    But if you were to pick up your dribble, you are down to Passing and Shooting, which can limit your options.
                    This is why having a solid foundation of dribbling can be important to improve as a player.

            <h2>Importance of Dribbling</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned before learning how to dribble the basketball effectively is an important aspect
                of the sport. Usually in a basketball game, the point guard has to learn how to dribble and run the 
                offense for the team. This can correlate with good ball movement, and creating opportunites for yourself
                and your team to score.
